"They used to be realistic about their delivery time, not anymore. For example, I needed a new power supply for my computer so I bought a ""get it by tomorrow"" (less options but fast enough). The delivery was late, got it in two days.

"The least intuitive UI experience in the history of front ends. Good luck going straight to where you want if you need to view your payment methods, messages, recent cs chats, etc. Numerous vague menus leading to even more vague submenues. Also, stupid in-search ads autoplay making the app crash on my phone. I don't need demos of other products when I'm literally in the middle of searching for something specific that I'm in need of.. much less when it has a 99% chance of crashing the app!",user-experience,Ugochukz,1,79,us
"I would give 5 stars but sometimes, I don't receive my packages on the scheduled day. I used to, but the past 2 yrs the accuracy of shipment has changed.

"Having amazon prime was amazing and the app made thing super easy and simple. But the problem i had, and it came out of nowhere, was that one day i logged on to buy a blanket. When i loggoed on, it asked for a two step verification code, which i had never done before. And on top of that, it was sending the code to a phone number i haven't used in 7+ years.

Amazon is a great service.to have. The only drawback for me is the filters for searching for your items.

Really good. I love the your package is x stops away feature. I would like to be able to postpone a subscription delivery instead of cancelling it.

Actually useful. Quite often will tell you stock levels whereas that information is often missing on manufacturers or suppliers websites. Similar to eBay in many respects but often a wider selection.

Just found that out today. But overall it's a good app. It's the most popular app to buy things on without going to each brands store. I do wish they would Not allow products from China. Had a lot being sold falsely and couldn't return. Amazon sided with seller even after proof was shown.,customer-service,Ugochukz,3,3,us
"Went to view status of an order and cannot view anything in app. *Update* Never mind, appears server crashed - fixed within a few hours and everything works again (well, the search algorithm is still sucky compared to ""FeePay"" - if you filter (for low-to-high for instance) you lose up to 90% of results, you cannot filter for origin to avoid long shipping times or questionable Chinese sellers...)",user-experience,Solomon,5,18,us
my experience is usually very good. But I have found that a lot of the merchant pricing is becoming equal to or more expensive than what you could purchase that item for on other websites or walking into a retail location. But when I do order from Amazon you get very fast service and they back what they sell and they have made it easier for returns.,user-experience,Solomon,4,37,us
"I have an Amazon warehouse nearby and can see exactly where the Amazon truck carrying my package is at the moment and how many stops it has left until it gets to me. Not applicable to everybody, but the app handles this feature really well. Also, in my experience, the app is actually a bit easier to navigate in some ways than the website. At least, the basic design is more intuitive. Also, as a general rating for the Amazon service, I'd also give 5 stars. It's easy to shop confidently.",user-experience,Solomon,5,94,us
"Cannot longer narrow searches to a specific area for example I want to select the book store and only search there, I should not have to specify a boolean search in the search bat ""in books"".

"Amazon itself is going down the drain. Prime is pointless and not worth the money now. Shipping is never 2 days, they change the shipping due dates all the time.

Shop Walmart, at least they act like they care.",shipping,Adam,1,2,uk
"It's fine, more convenient than using a browser... however the font size/magnification is a mess. Instead of respecting the device font size and screen magnification settings, Amazon has its own fixed font minimum sizes. So if your device is set to large fonts, and the screen magnification is set to larger, then unlike every other app in existence, this one has massive fonts in some places, normal fonts in others, and it cuts off buttons in the app because they're not properly adaptive.",user-experience,Adam,3,22,uk

Since nobody rings the doorbell anymore, I feel like thieves can steal the package in the 30-60 minutes it takes to get a notification that the package is delivered. ¬∂ It's slow to get to your orders (click on the ""person"" icon, takes 10 seconds, then Your Orders takes another few). ¬∂ Track Shipment, See all Updates is too many clicks, with attendant slowness between. ¬∂ It's annoying to refresh. Should be able to pull down instead of going back twice and then going to See all Updates again. ¬∂ Should be able to Swipe Left/Right between items in the Shipment details screen, but you can't. Do some UX testing, Amazon!",user-experience,Ugochukz,3,1,us

"It was all good until they decided to update it and make the whole app complicated to navigate. One, is your saved for later items. It gets stuck and you have to keep moving up and down a few times in order to your list appear... Frustrated ü•¥ I wish you could just go back to the previous one. Why update something that was working fine?!!! Please fix it before I pull whatever hair I have left on my head üôÑüòìü§Øüòñ‚úåüèª",user-experience,Adam,4,0,uk
Best place to get what you need with great service with great features if you upgrade your plan all respect for what this company offers it deserves no bad words just loyal kindness for everything it has to offer thank you Amazon for everything you offered me that's why I'm a loyal customer with only kind words,user-experience,Solomon,5,3,us
I downloaded this because a friend suggested I order off of Amazon I ordered a silent basketball it said it would be here from April 3-9 then April 9 came and it said it would have to be delayed,shipping,Solomon,1,0,us
I'm updating this but keeping it at three stars. For a time I noticed a really great feature in the app where you could check or uncheck items in your cart so that you didn't have to buy your entire cart and didn't have to put things in the save for later list. This feature has now somehow disappeared. I found it to be an extremely useful feature and would be very happy if it was brought back,user-experience,Ugochukz,3,63,us

"Took money for a canceled order, that I canceled before transferring the amount needed for the correct order. Was told 3-5 days for refund, then 7-10. Guessing I'm not getting my money back. Basically theft on their end when you think about it. Getting rid of account soon as I get my money. (If I ever do!!)",customer-service,Adam,1,1,uk
"Need to be able to add more info in additional delivery instructions. As for some odd reason delivery drivers do not even attempt to deliver to my address (even though they lie and say they have). I live in an apartment block with concierge at main reception, CCTV throughout the building, plus I have a Google doorbell. Yes there are several entrances, but only 1 for the public. So would be good to be able to post a picture stating where the entrance is like other delivery apps do.",shipping,Adam,4,88,uk

"I love shopping on Amazon. And I've never had a problem on my iPhones with the Amazon app. I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and this app always get stuck, stutters, delays for a long period of time, or crashes when I try looking at pictures on reviews.... It's frustrating and difficult. Unless this app gets optimized, I may have to go back to Iphone, that's how much I'm on Amazon.",user-experience,Ugochukz,1,166,us
"What happened to prime? I can't get anything shipped the next day unless I buy 3 of something, or spend more than $25! What do I pay monthly for just out of curiosity, plus I noticed I'm not getting free shipping on a lot of things! I've also noticed a lot of items I buy now are cheap like I'm buying them from Wish! I used to love Amazon, but not really much anymore.",shipping,Lailat,2,0,us
"I'm having issues with the Amazon app current version. Keeps freezing the screen and then the whole phone performance when I get to the reviews screen, scrolling through the reviews get hard and not smooth, like lagging and impossible to go to reviews page. Can't leave the page after selecting REVIEWS. But the rest of the app functions fine. Browsing, purchasing, returns are all fine. Once the phone restarted by itself after app freeze. New Samsung S23 ULTRA Please fix this issue",user-experience,Ugochukz,3,58,us

"Nice shopping experience, although I hate that when you try and search for sexual adult products through the application, it only shows a few items, even if you try to refresh it. You guys need to fix this, so that sexual products can be browsed with ease. I dont know if you guys hide the search from the app,but you need to fix this issue #Amazon.",user-experience,Solomon,4,74,us

Excellent but searching can be a real pain to find what you are looking for and why does sorting price low to high yield less results?,user-experience,Adam,4,0,us
"Cons: Freezes when scrolling. The search engine is horrible now, I can't find what I'm looking for anymore. It's incredible frustrating. When you leave the app without closing it will alway go back to the homepage and you will lose whatever you are searching for. The filter option is trash it doesn't even work. This app needs to be fixed. Pros: I love that I can create multiple wishlists and that I can share them. I love that you can get free shipping on certain orders.",user-experience,Ugochukz,1,799,us
"great app. the only complaint is they don't automatically check the free shipping option when shipping can be free. also, some updates ago the shipping selection was moved from a separate page to way down on a page... kinda hides the automatic selection for shipping. liked it better when you stepped thru those items on different pages.",shipping,Solomon,4,13,us
"The Amazon app works well! No worries with Amazon's shopping system. I'm satisfied with it! But, unfortunately, the app does not seem to have a way to clear the ""Keep Shopping For"" section of the home screen recommendations. I don't like that I can accidentally tap one of the generic search results on a blank Search box and have it completely affect my recommendations with no way to reset them or remove it from the ""Keep Shopping For"" suggestions section.",user-experience,Ugochukz,2,254,us
"My issue is that when searching thru my list of liked items whenever I click on an item and click back, the app always takes me back to the top of my list that's long. extremely frustrating Amazon. Also, when I'm searching for, say, laptop hard drives, the prices some sellers are asking are higher than most big box stores, and this causes concern over quality.",user-experience,Ugochukz,3,89,us
It is a good app and I would give it a full 5 stars EXCEPT the back button is clunky where it stalls. The app has so many features that it is so easy to use and informative to keep track of past orders and coming purchases. It's just the back button which is a basic function. Just fix that and it is the perfect shopping app.,user-experience,Solomon,4,1,us
"Great customer service, on time delivery, NOT! Prime used to be awesome! It's horrible now. You're no longer able to speak to a human being on the phone when there's a problem. Packages w prime are always late. What's the point of paying for Prime if it's going to take as long as non Prime members to be delivered or longer. Even Prime video sucks. You're paying for the membership, but most movies and shows still require you to pay to watch.",customer-service,Ugochukz,1,150,us
"Whenever I go to view my order, it hardly ever opens. The remaining may be Amazon problems: My address is charged more taxes and takes longer to deliver to than my friend who lives 5 miles away, and Prime is joke.",shipping,Solomon,3,0,us
"I love the convenience of finding practically everything you need from clothes, accessories, essential oils to housewares. I love that you can find reviews before purchasing products to make better buying choices. and of course, the most important is delivered right to my front door!",user-experience,Solomon,5,6,us
As a Amazon Prime member I like using this app. However I notice it has been gotten a bit worse. Lately I tried to filter out my search in order to get the things I need. Like 90% it glitches and does not work. Besides that interface could be more smoother. I like the Amazon but this app could be better in my opinion. Update: they have sorted of fixed the filtering feature but it's far from perfect. It's a bit laggy but doable...,user-experience,Solomon,4,98,us
"Pretty good for shopping. Selection is absurdly huge. Quality is hit and miss and I can be hard to tell what ""brands"" are legit or just a Chinese company making a shoddy knockoff for a few bucks. The UI in the mobile is atrocious and the wesite should be drug out into street and shot. Still though. They have what you need and can get it to you really quickly.",user-experience,Ugochukz,3,6,us
