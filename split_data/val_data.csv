"Amazon shopping for me is a game changer. As a disabled full-time employed person, having to go shopping on my only day off is a painful and dreadful task. Ordering most of what I need online and getting those products in a timely manner (most times the same day) is fantastic. The delivery folks are great. The mobile app is so responsive and I've never had an error. I have a great working relationship with Amazon. They have provided an excellent service for me since day one.",user-experience,Solomon,5,135,us

"You gotta watch Amazon because they are consistently priced higher than other leading competitors and is difficult as a consumer, to make that sacrifice in money, even though we would like to support the company. However, I've stopped shopping at Walmart because they've gone all China and it bothers me. Also, they make you pay a fairly steep membership fee and then an additional $7-$19.99 to get items delivered that are under $35 and it's too much when I order as little as possible, often.",shipping,Adam,4,18,uk
"Well done Amazon 5* for making a nice easy app for shopping a massive pain in the neck. Search feature now comes up with just about every other irrevelevant item and can only scoll through a few on each page now.

"Perhaps this is more of an indictment of Google Play Store and whole ridiculous Google system of security. But, it's a serious design flaw when you can make all sorts of purchases with this app (thankfully) without entering your gmail password every time you do, but suddenly have to enter it if the thing you want to purchase is Prime Membership. And when Play Store isn't set up to recognize your password, it is round and round trying to get it to work. Google really stinks.",security,Lailat,2,0,us

Although I enjoyed Amazon I shared an account with a family member when they canceled their membership and I went to make my own it was INCREDIBLY HARD to sign out of their account and when I went to create my own it said my number was assigned to another account when I don't and haven't had one.

"Most folks are pretty familiar with the concept of Amazon shopping in some extent or another. However, recently been getting annoyed about a rather obnoxious UI decision: There are in-app vibrations that you have absolutely no way of turning off without disabling system-wide vibrations.

Well ever since I remade the account they have been non stop charging my card for the membership fee, $16 about 3 times a month, after I have already paid it. It's happened again this month.

I am very happy with my Amazon shopping experience. The costs and wide range of availability of products is good and the alternatives that are also shown when searching is useful. Delivery times and alternative delivery options such as lockers are also good. It is a shame that they are unable to manage the delivery drivers who are often a huge let down. Packaging is good as well. Returns and refunds are managed in a simple and prompt way. Customer Services usually resolve matters well.,user-experience,Solomon,5,43,us
"Dear Android developers working on the ""filter"" feature: the feature is a downgrade since the last update. Too many clicks are required to apply multiple filters. The screen switches far too many times. For those working on the frontend, its gorgeous as per usual! Even with the multiple clicks. Backend: page transitions are a bit slow (as far as that filter feature). Perhaps I over-filter, but I would love for the Search and Discovery (perhaps) team to return this feature to pre-update version.",user-experience,Ugochukz,3,6,us
"Mostly good and very convenient, especially for the housebound. Returns have been made more disabled and housebound friendly with the home collections option. Customer services needs improvement like many others. Delivery drivers can upload their photos but some 'hide' that it's very damaged to the back or bottom. They not only should be given extra bags and courtesy apology notes to put damaged packages in but Amazon should allow customers to upload their own photo of the damaged delivery.",customer-service,Solomon,4,19,us

Having an issue with my saved lists. It keeps crashing when I keep trying to move items that accidently went to the wrong list or deleting items that are no longer available.

Simply good ...edit 9.2.22 I love the app but my only gripe is that I would rather use the browser version because I can put in an exact price point that I don't want to go over for specific items.

The last time a shipment of water was said to be undeliverable to the post office, I received a message saying that I would receive reimbursement. To date, I have not been reimbursed.

"Prime: be very careful when you activate prime. Apparently it now goes through Google play, and it gets auto renewed with no refunds. This was not announced and after calling Amazon to cancel prime membership, they say that they cannot cancel and I have to take it up with Google.

Back to scrolling on Amazon now",customer-service,Adam,3,21,uk

"This app is solid for the most part. When it is working, which I'd say is about 85% of the time, it works as well as anyone could expect. That other 15% is insta-closing or not starting up at all. Which is incredibly frustrating. Sometimes I see a flash of the app main page. Other times tapping the app to open it results in absolutely nothing at all. When the app gets into these fits (which isnt all that often, but one time is too many) restarting my phone does nothing to remedy. Amazon website still works fine during this. As does Amazon video app. Its solely an issue with the shopping app it seems. This is incredibly annoying as I shouldn't have to resort to the desktop site because someone cant iron out the faults of an app that shouldn't have this kind of problem.",user-experience,Solomon,4,4,us

Disappointing and I feel like this feature is missing (or really really hard to find) in order to milk you for all the money you have.,privacy,Ugochukz,2,11,us
"Now that amazon has established itself as the most convenient way to get what you want now you pay more for absolutely everything. All the prices have gone up, your prime payment has gone up all because no one can put a specific amount of money on convenience.",user-experience,Ugochukz,1,1,us
It keeps freezing up. It never used to be like this.,user-experience,Lailat,2,0,us
"This app absolutely hates my VPN. Continuous stalls, hangs, and timeouts. Eventually, by refreshing the Home or My Account buttons over and over and over again, I can eventually get through and from there things work fine. I suspect that this is an intentional oversight, that Amazon doesn't feel particularly motivated to expend effort tracking down issues with customers who attempt to shield a tiny scrap of their privacy from their all-seeing eye.",privacy,Ugochukz,2,12,us
"They put my acct on hold because they thought a purchase was fraud. No problem, I like that they had security. I provided them the details, they said it wasn't good enough. I made sure it checked off all their requirements. Still not good enough they just closed my account. I'm literally looking at ANY option other than Amazon for ANYTHING. What a junk company and junk service.",security,Ugochukz,1,58,us
Amazon please help me. Everytime I click on my orders it doesn't load up anything. It's an on and off thing but it just keeps reloading/refreshing the page without showing me my orders. Been happening for a year now. Thanks,user-experience,Adam,4,2,uk
"The breakdown of the orders makes no sense. I get that items are coming from different places when ordering, but could everything be on the same ""receipt"" not broken down to show me individual prices and taxes, so when I look for how much I spent in total on one transaction it shows up like that? I don't want to use a calculator to add up all the totals. One order with 5 items becomes 3 or more separate orders. The order filter category is a terrible experience and not helpful at all.",user-experience,Ugochukz,2,199,us
"Great app, we use it all the time with little to no issues. Had an issue today where an item shows delivered but was just not there, that could be the fault of USPS, but there isn't an option in the return or replace for an item that shows delivered but wasn't. I'd give 5 stars if they added that. In the past when there have been delivery issues, their customer service has been top notch and quick to resolve things. Overall a very positive experience.",shipping,Solomon,4,125,us

"Used to be a lot better, moving search to the bottom of the app is extremely inconvenient, I'm always hitting it now. While I appreciate it being in a static location, top of the screen would be much better. Also, pain finding books and audiobooks, search results usually are about 90% what I'm not looking for. Pretty much every part of the store could be categorized better. *Edit* Now the darn thing keeps crashing. It's becoming difficult to shop on my phone.",user-experience,Ugochukz,1,520,us
Ordered some things and did next day delivery but most of my packages get delayed to a few days later,shipping,Lailat,3,0,us
"HELP!...... PLEASE! For the past week, shopping in peace is impossible! I've had to give up and shop for some of my orders on Walmart... And I hate Walmart but had no other choice! The app.... is crashing and won't stop crashing, no matter what I do from clearing cache, (on both phone and in app), clearing search history in browser, and even shutting phone down and restarting. NOTHING I've done is working! Thank you!",user-experience,Ugochukz,1,29,us
