"GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE! It's needed because a few storefronts are unscrupulous in their business practices (not truthful about delivery dates, material content, sizing not accurate, etc.). I also am disappointed in the search capabilities. If I search for a product with a required ingredient or description, results are for everything under the sun, & often not what I'm looking for. I'd rather see fewer accurate results than things I can't use. An alternative search word suggestion would be fine.",Adam,4,11,uk

Currently waiting on the phone for 40 minutes to talk to ups, if i have to do this again i will think three times before ordering the next product. Edit: amazon has no option to say that the package never arrived, lowering score to two stars. I dont want to deal with this. Edit, amazon accepted the return automatically.",Solomon,4,2,us
"Dangnabbit. I think the drivers are awesome. Amazon is great in following my delivery instructions. But, when a delivery is X stops away, the screen for that is poor. 2/3 of it is covered with other info. Also, there is no simple way to report concerns. Is that designed to deter important feedback?",Adam,4,29,uk

The app is basically useless if you want to do anything other than order stuff. The chatbot even tells you to use your computer for simple things like changing addresses for shipping. For instance my niece ordered 50lbs of dog food in December. Because she used her phone it automatically sent it to me because she had sent me a gift previously. Stuff I just ordered automatically was sent to the last person I sent a gift. Chatbot told me to use a computer. Android phone is a computer.,Solomon,1,0,us

Sick of the constant glitches this app has. It doesnt show show correct product information or when it does it doesnt add correct size or selection to cart. Im having to constantly get Amazon to pickup their incorrect items for return & then lose interest in buying correct item again due to hassle & wait on refunds!

"I remember back when below an item there used to be a row of items that were similar to what you were looking at. Now there are 4 or 5 rows throughout the description and they are all sponsored or made by Amazon. I feel they are pushing certain items or brands instead of letting us see all our options.

"Attn Developers! I don't know what you all did in the latest update, but I cannot use the app at all, it keeps crashing! Because it keeps crashing, I can't shop on amazon, therefore you lose money.

I'm finding there is very little Amazon does not have availiable to purchase. I have easily over 200 orders in the last several years and have only had one incorrect order. it was still the same brand just different product. having multiple suppliers allows you to shop prices and get the best deal. for the most part shipments are incredibly fast. I love the Amazon app. Amazon also supports small businesses in allowing for easy inclusion on the app to sell their products!,Solomon,5,138,us
"This is not really an app, but a quick link direct to the Amazon website. The problem being that it's a very high data consuming website, (using additional data thru Playstore, etc.) so as well as what you're searching for, you're being bombarded by advertisers' long videos. It's too much data for phone to cope with, & sometimes over slow Wi-Fi.

I know how to do that already, and I do not need you to show me.",Ugochukz,2,822,us
"It would be nice if the app had light mode, dark mode, and system settings options. I put my phone in dark mode during the night, and nothing is worse than opening an app and getting blinded.

Hate using Amazon with afterpay. I've spoken many times with afterpay about billing issues and they tell me the issues are caused by Amazon having a delay in their billing process. I don't have those issues when I order from eBay and this doesn't happen just once or twice it happens EVERYTIME and it's very inconvenient especially since afterpay took away their mint no payment up front process. I paid almost $300 down payment on a $1000 order for them to screw up billing on.,Ugochukz,2,16,us

And, if I change any one filter, I need to order it again from cheapest first. It's a simple a major thing to sort for a big company. If things in my basket moved to purchase, it'll often automatically move my items to more avoidable expensive delivery options. If changed back to free, it'll load for too long.",Adam,3,77,uk

REALLY annoying recently with the ad popups. The delivery notifications aren't as good as they used to be and Prime hasn't been 2 days ship for years. The quality of nearly all goods is garbage.

"If you are familiar with shopping at Amazon then you pretty much already know how the app works when buying something. However, if you purchased something that Amazon itself will make the delivery (i.e. Prime or expedited 2 or 3 day delivery, or some other situation), this is where the app shines because when the item is ""Out for Delivery"", you will be presented as map showing the approx. Location of your package and a notation as to how many stops the driver has before your package and I'll be delivered. The ""current location"" of the driver is approximate (for their safety"" but it's accurate enough so you can plan and 100% accurate when it's delivered. And when it's delivered you will see a photo showing exactly where it is. Those two things are an indicator to me that they have us, the consumer, in mind because it is us (for the most part) who really benefits.",Solomon,5,513,us

Great app overall. It has all the features you would expect from an online shopping platform. I like unique features such as Buy Again. My biggest gripe and the reason for a 1 star deduction is the reviews. The very thing that kept me coming back to the platform early on.

üóëüëéüí© Tracking packages that are delivered BY Amazon on the app is always incorrect. Will notify you package is stops away - only THEN to push back the delivery time as TBD.

"I often use this for browsing on Amazon, but I don't like how little detail is visible before I click on something. I often click on items just to see what they are, since all I can see is a picture, so I end up with a lot of unnecessary recommendations relating to items that I only read the titles for. Another problem with the app is how it is slow and unresponsive when I try to scroll, especially compared to Internet browsers. While I enjoy the service, the app doesn't improve my experience.",Ugochukz,2,98,us

The 5 monthly payment makes no sense. It authorises all the money and then it releases some of it and charges you for that month and every month you have to have the remaining balance but if you already had the money you could just pay it off and then they freeze the money in your account fro 7 days so I don't see the point if you have to have the money in your account you might as well just pay for it.,Ugochukz,3,0,us

The List feature is clutch, which isn't unique to the app. The Cart itself could use an over-haul in its design, though; like multiple carts (for people who like to budget & prolly others, as well); Save to List> from Saved For Later; a one-page checkout option (like Buy Now) but for your whole cart, instead of a 3? page checkout. I understand the need for confirmation but I think it's a little much. I use this app all the time, though; should prolly be 4 stars.",Ugochukz,3,0,us
